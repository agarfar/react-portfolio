      <p>
        I am a San Diego native with a longstanding love of the ocean and the outdoors. My experience
        includes utilizing remote sensing techniques and geospatial analyses to develop comprehensive 
        geographic information systems for private clients and unmanned system operators.
         
        I wish to further my programming and developer skills to attain a developer role within the field of
        Geographic Information Systems.
